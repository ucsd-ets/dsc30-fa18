/**
 * Implementation of KNN classifier using KD tree.
 *
 * This program takes in 4 command line arguments and outputs a file called "result.txt". The first command line is
 * the choice of K as in KNN. The second one is the name of the training data file. The third one is the name of input
 * data file. The fourth one is a flag which is either "validation" or "test"
 *
 * Training data file:
 *
 * Each line of the training data file is a data. It should have number of d features (double)
 * following by a single label (int). All these number should be separated by space.
 * For example, if d = 3, each line of training data file should has the format:
 *
 * 7.27 6.25 6.12 1
 *
 * Where "7.27 6.25 6.12" is 3 features of this data, and "1" is the label of this data.
 *
 * Input data file:
 *
 * 1. If the fourth argument is "validation".
 *
 * The input data file should have the same format as training data file.
 * In this case we are trying to use input data file as validation data and find the validation error. This should
 * be done by counting number of times our classifier have made mistakes (number of "label mismatch" between our
 * predicted labels and actual labels in input data file) and divide it by the input data size. We can then decide
 * which K to choose based on the validation error.
 *
 * Your output file should contains the value of K and its corresponding validation error. For example,
 * if we choose K = 3 and the validation error is 0.1, then the output file should has a single line with:
 *
 * K: 3, Validation Error: 0.1
 *
 * 2. If the fourth argument is "test".
 *
 * Each line of the input data file should only contains the features of this data, with no label following.
 * In this case we are trying to use input data file as test data and find the k nearest neighbors of data 
 * in each line of input file.
 *
 * Each line of your output file should contains the predicted label for the data in the corresponding line of input
 * data file. For example, if input file has 2 lines of data, and your KNN classifier predict that the label for both
 * of those data is 1. Then your output file should have two lines as the following:
 *
 * 1
 * 1
 *
 * Please refer to the write up for more details
